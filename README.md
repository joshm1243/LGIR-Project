##  <b>Find our solution at: https://lncn.ac/LGIR </b>

`LGIR` is a lightweight, easy to use visual programming language for robotics. Group 7 designed this project as our submission for our Team Software Engineering assignment. 
It's designed for beginners to easily understand and start working with the field.

**Usage**
---
---
If you're intending to test this, we assume that you're a lecturer marking our work. Please see our report for login details, as they will be included there. If you'd like to test our work anyway (provided the LGIR system is still running by then) please contact us via GitHub.


We wanted to make this system as easy as possible to access, so we've containerised it all and put it up on the cloud. It's all accessible through the web, which will allow for easier marking. Just follow the steps below to get there!

1. Click right here! -> [`LGIR Link`](https://lncn.ac/lgir)
    + `Login with the details we've given you (either in the report or personally)`
    + `Let us know if you have any issues!`

2. To see a pre-assembled project after logging in, click on the Join Project With Code button on the navbar and type in the code:

## **FAQ**
---
### **How do I get login details?**
This project was designed over the course of a year with an assignment submission in mind. As such, the only ones that should currently have login details are our testers and lecturer marking our work. Contact either [@Korbarus (Ethan)](https://www.github.com/Korbarus) or [@joshm1243 (Josh)](https://www.github.com/joshm1243) for login details, assuming our servers are still up.

<br>

### **The webpage is down! What do I do?**
As stated above, this project is designed with an assessment in mind. As such, the servers will only run until late August 2021 at best. This is due to financial constraints as the project is hosted on the cloud entirely out of our own pockets. It's been a real passion project and we wanted to make sure we could offer the best solution possible for the highest grade. In the event that it is down before this time, please contact [@Korbarus (Ethan)](https://www.github.com/Korbarus) for technical support. They are responsible for the cloud configuration and as such will be able to solve the issues.

<br>

### **I'm so confused! How does the system work? Where can I find help?**
Thankfully, we've thought ahead and filled out the GitHub repository's wiki pages with useful information to help you navigate and understand our solution effectively. LGIR works through an abstraction layer, so we do have our own specialised tech to support the process. Documentation for this can be found [here.](https://github.com/joshm1243/lgirproject/wiki)

<br>

### **What motivated you to make this project?**
As students we've had a passion for robotics, but understand that with the age of ROS it can be a terrifying field to try and get involved in. With LGIR, we've simplified the core elements of robotics and allowed users to understand how things work in a simpler way. We hope that this project allows those with interest in robotics to start their learning journey with something a little more manageable as opposed to diving in at the deep end.
